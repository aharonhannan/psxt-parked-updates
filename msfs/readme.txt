In this folder PSXseeconTraffic will automatically place the airport files for which it has added 
real live Airline+Type options to parking positions, or updated the percentage_parked.

You should also put your manually edited, updated and or created airport files here.

If PSXseeconTraffic needs an airport file, it will always first search in this folder, then 
in the \addon_airports folder and finally in the \stock_airports folder.
